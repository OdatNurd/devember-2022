# Devember 2022 - Omphalos

This repository represents my entry into [Devember](https://devember.org/) 2022
and is a re-implementation/re-imagining  of [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg),
which is what was behind my [devember-2021](https://github.com/OdatNurd/devember-2021)
project.

If you're viewing this in December of 2022, development work is ongoing live on
my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/odatnurd), which is serving as the daily
devlog requirement of Devember. What better way to follow what the day's work
was than to actually watch the day's work?

At the end of each day, the last commit made on that day (if any) is tagged,
allowing for easy viewing of the progression of the project over the given time
period.

The project is code named Omphalos:
> om-pha-los, [noun]
> * a central point or hub

Along with the primary connotation of this being a control panel or hub of
creation, I would also point out that in software development "naming things is
hard". ALSO, the tagline can be "Add some Oomph to your stream with omphalos",
so it has that going for it.
