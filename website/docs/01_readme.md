This project originally started as my [Devember][1] project for 2022. During
that month development started from scratch and by the 31st of December 2022
the  project was in the state that you see reflected in the documentation here.

As such, the documentation seen here, as well as the links to the code and
such, reflect the development status of the project during that period of time.
If you check out the [source code][2] of the project there are tags which track
the progress of the development day by day.

This is not to say that the project is dead; rather the opposite. Development
on the project still continues, but not in this repository (and thus not
reflected in the live documentation site) so as to leave this version as a
historical record.

The full project page (which is undoubtedly eerily similar to this one for some
fairly obvious reasons) can be found at https://omphalos.ruinouspileofcrap.com/.

If you're interested in the project, that's the version you should be looking
at.
