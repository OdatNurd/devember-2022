title: Creating Bundles
---

Omphalos itself is just a ***container*** that allows you free form access to
create your own graphical overlays, control panel pages and server side code,
allowing them all to connect together.

To actually make use of the software, you need to install one or more `bundles`,
which add functionality to the app and therefore your stream.

This page would talk about this in some brief detail, including perhaps a small
tutorial to get a new user up and running. The docusaurus documentation has some
information on being able to pull live files into the documentation, so this
could be done by linking directly to the sample bundle perhaps, allowing the
docs to always be fully in line with the current default.
