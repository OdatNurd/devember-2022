title: Graphics
---

This page would discuss graphics, which are simple `html` pages that you write
that Omphalos will serve out to your stream software (e.g. `obs`) and can
display anything you like.

There is a section in the manifest that controls graphics; probably talk about
that more here and have the manifest page only briefly cover the options and
link here or whatever.
