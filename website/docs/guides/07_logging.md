title: Logging
---

This page would talk about logging, log rolling, levels and provide more details
on the timestamp and filename options that are available.

Touch in here on the details of all of the log levels, when they are likely to
be used, the different log outputs, and how the different parts of the apps have
a different tag on them, including the logs generated by bundles.
