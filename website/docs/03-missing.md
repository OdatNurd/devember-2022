title: Missing Features
---

There are some features of Omphalos that are planned but are either still in
development or not yet started. You may see references to this in the
documentation or code; however if you see the item here, that feature is not
yet ready.

1. Full Bleed Panels
2. Single Instance Graphics
3. Multiple Workspaces (currently, the single workspace is hard coded)
